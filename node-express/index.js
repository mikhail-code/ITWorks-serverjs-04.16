// + Data Model:Define the data structures in-memory:
// + Authors: An array of objects, each representing an author with properties like id, name, and dateOfBirth.
// + Books: An array of objects, each representing a book with properties like name, price, and authorId that references an authorâ€™s id.

// + API Endpoints:Implement the following RESTful endpoints:
// + GET /books: Retrieve a list of all books, optionally include author details embedded in the response.
// + GET /books/:id: Retrieve a specific book by its ID, including author details.
// + POST /books: Create a new book (ensure that the authorId exists in the authors array before adding the book).
// + PUT /books/:id: Update an existing book by its ID.
// + DELETE /books/:id: Delete a book by its ID.

// +++ Validation and Error Handling:
// Validate name and price during book creation and updates. 
// Ensure authorId exists in the authors array before saving a new book.
// Implement error handling to respond appropriately when requests fail validation checks or when resources are not found.

// Deliverables:
// Source code committed to a version control repository.
